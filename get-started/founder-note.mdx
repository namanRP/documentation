**Superintelligence for fundraising that actually works the way you work.**

## Why CapitalxAI exists

If you have raised capital, advised founders, or run outreach for clients, you know the grind. Endless investor lists, fragmented data, weak signals of fit, and far too much time spent figuring out who to talk to and how to approach them. We built CapitalxAI because we lived this problem, deeply and personally.

I am Naman Kasliwal, an ex YC founder who has raised capital twice. Alongside me is Durga Rao, who has spent years managing large scale investor outreach and understanding what truly moves the needle. Between us, we have seen fundraising from every angle, as founders, as advisors, and as operators behind the scenes.

For the past two years, we worked hand in hand with an investment bank to shape this product around real workflows, real deals, and real constraints. This is not a polished experiment. This is version two of CapitalxAI, a fully automated platform that brings powerful investor insights, smart outreach, and a clean workflow into one unified dashboard.

## Built for how you actually fundraise

CapitalxAI is designed for three kinds of users, and we take each seriously.

Everything here is built around one simple goal: make your work easier while increasing your chances of success.

## Discover the right investors, not just more investors

CapitalxAI does not just surface names. It helps you qualify fit using AI across stage, sector, geography, check size, and past behavior. You get relationship pathways, deep investor intelligence, and clear signals instead of overwhelming noise.

We are committed to covering the full universe of investors. If anyone is missing from our database, tell us and we will add them for free. Our ambition is that you never feel limited by your tools.

## Reach out with clarity and confidence

Great outreach is about relevance, timing, and positioning. CapitalxAI helps you craft the right pitch, personalize your messaging, and structure your approach so you come across as thoughtful and prepared, never desperate.

You can track everything in a built-in pipeline, see what is working through analytics, and manage credits, security, and support all in one place. No more messy trackers, scattered notes, or disjointed systems.

## Move fast without cutting corners

Fundraising often feels like a race against time. CapitalxAI is built for anyone who wants to expand their pipeline and reach a large set of investors within days, not months.

This is not just another investor database or CRM. It is an AI powered system that organizes your work, sharpens your strategy, and amplifies your effort.

## Your time is your most valuable asset

Ultimately, CapitalxAI is for anyone who wants to increase their pipeline and reach a huge set of qualified investors within days—not months. It gives you back your time and your focus.

## Our vision

This is version two, but we are just getting started. Our vision is to build the most powerful fundraising platform in the world, one that genuinely transforms how founders, bankers, and advisors raise capital.

**We are building the product we wish we had when we were in your shoes.**
