## Qualifying fit starts with pattern recognition

The real goal isn't just to find any investor—it's to find the **right** one. Successful fundraisers don't just look at firm size; they analyze investment patterns. They ask: _Does this investor have a proven thesis in my specific semantic space? Do they have the context to "get it" on the first call?_

What you might not realize is that an investor's past investments are the strongest signal of their future interest. The key is moving from a generic list to a **qualified shortlist** based on strategic alignment, not just brand name.

<Tip>
  Think of an investor's portfolio as a map of their conviction. If the map leads to your space, you're already halfway to a "yes."
</Tip>

## How CapitalxAI gives you that clarity instantly

We built **Similar Investments** to turn portfolio analysis from a days-long research chore into a **10-second insight**. Our AI maps your company's profile against an investor's entire history, then clearly categorizes their past deals into four intuitive scenarios.

It's like having a strategist highlight exactly where you stand with every firm on your list.

## How it works: your strategic lens on any portfolio

For every investor profile, you'll see a clear breakdown of their past investments relative to your company. Here's how to read each category and act on it.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Direct Competitors" icon="swords">
    **What it means:** The firm has backed companies targeting the same customers with a similar solution in your market.

    **Your move:** Proceed with caution. Unless it's a known accelerator model, this often indicates a conflict. Use the [Exclude Investors](/qualifying-investors/exclude-investors) tool to filter these firms out so you can prioritize your time elsewhere.

    <Warning>
      A competitive overlap doesn't always mean a dead end—some firms run multi-bet strategies—but it's critical to know about it before you pitch.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Similar Companies" icon="copy">
    **What it means:** They've invested in companies with a closely related model or solution, even if not an exact match. They believe in your category.

    **Your move:** Prioritize. These are your **strongest leads**. They already understand your space, your challenges, and your potential. Your pitch can dive deep from day one. Use the [Find Investors of a Company](/identifying-investors/investors-of-a-company) tool to discover every backer of those similar companies and expand your list further.

    <Tip>
      Reference the specific portfolio company you share a similarity with in your outreach. It instantly builds credibility.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjacent Spaces" icon="waypoints">
    **What it means:** Their investments are in tangentially related areas (e.g., they back AI for sales, and you're building AI for customer success).

    **Your move:** Strong potential. This signals a firm building expertise in your broader domain. They are likely actively looking to expand into your specific niche—your opportunity to be their first. Use the [Find Investors of a Company](/identifying-investors/investors-of-a-company) tool to trace their adjacent bets and map the full extent of their thesis.

    <Info>
      Adjacent investors often make the most enthusiastic partners. You're not just another portfolio company—you're the missing piece in their thesis.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Relatable Investments" icon="circle-off">
    **What it means:** The firm hasn't made a clear pattern of investments in or near your space.

    **Your move:** Context is key. There's no automatic insight here. Use this awareness to shape your conversation—you may need to provide more foundational education about the market opportunity before getting to your product specifics.
