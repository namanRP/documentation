## The problem: pitching blind on valuation

You share your valuation, and the conversation goes cold. It happens because every investor has a range they're willing to pay, but that range is almost never public. You might be asking for \$30M from a fund whose typical check size is \$2M, or targeting a moonshot investor when your round is priced for efficiency. Without knowing where you stand, you waste time pitching investors who were never a fit on the single most critical term: price.

## Investment history is your best signal

An investor's past deals reveal their true comfort zone. Funds develop patterns—some consistently write smaller checks at lower valuations, while others pay up for category leaders. Successful founders don't guess; they match their ask to an investor's historical behavior. When your valuation fits neatly within their pattern, you're not negotiating—you're aligning.

<Tip>
  Think of an investor's deal history as a pricing fingerprint. If your round fits the pattern, the conversation starts from common ground.

## Filter investors by their actual check size

CapitalxAI gives you the filters that matter. We analyze an investor's past deals to show you their real-world check size, minimum and maximum valuation preferences, and investment philosophy—all in one view. Instantly see who invests in your range and who doesn't. No more hoping; just data-driven targeting.

## How it works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Size Filter" icon="banknote">
    Search for investors by the exact amount they typically invest. See who writes \$500K checks versus \$5M checks—so you target the right tier from the start.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Valuation Range Filter" icon="sliders-horizontal">
    Set your target valuation and find investors whose historical deals fall within your range—or who stretch above it. Match your ask to their proven comfort zone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Investment Philosophy Deep Dive" icon="brain">
    Go beyond the numbers. Understand **why** an investor pays what they do—whether they're valuation-sensitive or chasing outliers. This context turns data into strategy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stage-Specific Data" icon="layers">
    All filters are tailored to your funding stage (Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A) based on actual portfolio history. You see what's relevant to **your** raise, not a generic average.
  </Accordion>
