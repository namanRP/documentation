## Investor information is all over the place

Finding an investor's actual focus shouldn't be a scavenger hunt—but it is. One fund lists its thesis on Crunchbase, another only mentions it in an AngelList bio, some hint at it in old LinkedIn posts, and many bury it deep on their website. This makes building a target list slow and frustrating. You waste valuable time piecing together clues instead of preparing your pitch. When you don't have this clarity, you risk reaching out to the wrong people, damaging your momentum before you even start.

## Clarity comes from consolidation

The issue isn't that investors don't have a thesis—it's that the information is **fragmented**. Successful founders centralize this research so they can act quickly. When you can immediately see what an investor cares about, you stop guessing and start prioritizing. The goal isn't just to collect data; it's to turn scattered signals into a clear roadmap for outreach.

## All investment signals, organized in one view

CapitalxAI pulls everything together. Our AI fundraising agent scours Crunchbase, AngelList, LinkedIn, fund websites, news, and more to find and summarize each investor's stated thesis. You no longer have to jump between tabs and sources. Instead, you get a clear, concise snapshot right on their profile. See their focus at a glance, then use our deep AI tools to analyze the fit.

<Tip>
  Think of thesis research like assembling a puzzle. We've already put the pieces together—you just need to look at the picture.
