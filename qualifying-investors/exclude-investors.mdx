## The same investors keep showing up

You keep seeing the same investors in every search—the ones who already passed, the firms that don't invest in your geography, investors who back your direct competitors, or that individual partner you just don't want to connect with. It's frustrating. Every time you filter for new leads, you waste mental energy skipping over the same irrelevant names. This noise slows you down and makes it harder to spot the fresh, promising opportunities.

## A great pipeline is built by strategic elimination

The fastest way to a quality list isn't just adding more names; it's decisively removing the wrong ones. Successful fundraisers treat their pipeline like a curated portfolio. They actively filter out past outcomes and known mismatches to create a clean slate. This focused view allows you to operate with clarity and prevents you from accidentally duplicating effort or revisiting dead ends.

<Tip>
  Think of your investor list like a garden. Pruning the dead branches isn't a setback—it's what lets the best opportunities grow.

## Permanently filter out any firm or individual

CapitalxAI lets you build your list from a clean sheet. Our Exclude Investors feature allows you to permanently remove specific venture firms or individual partners from appearing in your searches and recommendations. Simply add their website domain or LinkedIn profile URL to your exclusion list. Once added, our AI respects your preference and focuses only on presenting new, relevant potential partners.

## Set your rules in seconds

It's built to be simple and permanent. Head to your [Account Settings](https://app.capitalxai.com/account) to configure your Exclude Investors preferences.
