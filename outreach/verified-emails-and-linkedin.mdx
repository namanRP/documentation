## Finding investors is easy. Reaching them is the hard part.

Finding investors is one thing. Finding how to actually reach them is a whole other, frustrating job. This isn't fundraising—it's digital detective work.

You bounce between LinkedIn, company websites, and search results, trying to piece together clues. You guess email formats (is it `first.last@firm.com` or `f.last@firm.com`?), copy-paste names, and hope for the best. For five contacts, maybe that works. But for 50? Or 500? The process falls apart completely.

<Warning>
  Professionals spend an average of **40% of their fundraising time** just hunting for contact information. That's time you could spend refining your pitch, running your company, or having actual conversations with investors.
</Warning>

## Why guessed data actively hurts your fundraise

The damage goes far beyond wasted time. Bad contact data creates a chain reaction that undermines your entire outreach strategy.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Emails bounce" icon="circle-x" color="#dc2626">
    Guessed email addresses have a **30–50% bounce rate**. That's like throwing half your outreach effort straight into the trash.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain reputation tanks" icon="shield-alert" color="#ca8a04">
    Every bounce signals email servers that you have bad data. Gmail and Outlook start routing your emails—including crucial follow-ups and term sheet correspondence—to **spam**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool costs pile up" icon="credit-card" color="#6366f1">
    LinkedIn Sales Navigator, email enrichment tools, verification services—you end up managing **multiple subscriptions** for a piecemeal process that still might give you bad data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Your sender reputation works like a credit score. Every bounced email and dead inbox lowers it. You're not just failing to connect today—you're sabotaging your ability to connect tomorrow.
</Note>

## The real bottleneck is in your browser tabs

Between spreadsheets, browser tabs, and half-written scripts, your outreach stalls before it even begins. The worst part? The perfect investor might be sitting in your list, but with outdated or unverified info, you'll never reach them. You're not building momentum—you're managing chaos.

**The problem isn't a lack of data—it's a lack of reliable data.** Successful fundraisers don't just send more emails; they send smarter emails. They know that a verified, direct line to a decision-maker is infinitely more valuable than a hundred generic leads. The difference isn't volume—it's **precision and trust** in your data.
