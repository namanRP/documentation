## A shift in perspective

The issue isn't that your investors are unwilling to help. It's that **"help" is undefined**. Successful founders don't just ask for help; they guide it. They transform a broad ask into a specific, easy-to-execute request by doing the homework first. The difference lies in moving from saying *"Can you introduce me to investors?"* to presenting a clear, researched pathway and saying, *"Here's exactly how you can help us most effectively."*

<Tip>
  The best asks are the easiest to say yes to. When you do the research upfront, your investors can act immediately instead of guessing how to help.
</Tip>

## The difference between a vague ask and a strategic one

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Without CapitalxAI">
    ### The hopeful approach

    You send a broad message to your investor: *"Hey, do you know anyone who might be interested in our round?"*

    <Frame>
      > *"Sure, let me think about it..."*
      >
      > — **Translation: This goes to the bottom of their to-do list.**
    </Frame>

    Your investor means well but has no idea where to start. The ask is too open-ended, requires too much effort on their part, and quietly dies in their inbox.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="With CapitalxAI">
    ### The precision approach

    You send a researched, specific message: *"I noticed that Sequoia co-invested with you in Acme Corp's Series A. Given our similar focus on developer tools, would you be comfortable introducing me to their partner who led that deal?"*

    <Frame>
      > *"Absolutely—I'll forward your deck with a note right now."*
      >
      > — **That's the power of a well-researched, specific ask.**
    </Frame>

    Your investor can act **immediately**. The ask is clear, the connection is warm, and the context makes it effortless for them to advocate on your behalf.
