## The scavenger hunt problem

As a founder, you know the best investors often have application forms on their websites. Finding those links feels like a digital scavenger hunt. You waste hours digging through blog posts, old tweets, and portfolio sites, only to wonder if the link is even current. It's frustrating because it steals time from what you should be doing: actually **building your business** and **crafting your pitch**. Ignore these direct channels, and you're missing out on critical, structured opportunities to get in front of the right people.

<Warning>
  Direct application portals are often time-sensitive. A stale link or a missed deadline means a lost opportunity—and you may not even know it happened.
</Warning>

## Your direct application hub

That's why we built **Submission Links**. Think of it as your centralized, always-updated directory for investor application forms. Our system continuously scans for these direct submission portals, verifies them, and places them right in your dashboard. It turns a days-long search into a **one-click action**, ensuring you never miss a formal application opportunity.

<Tip>
  The best fundraising strategies combine warm intros with direct applications. Submission Links ensures the direct channel is always covered, so you can focus your energy on building relationships.
