## You're sending generic emails

As a founder, you know you should personalize every investor outreach. But between building your product and running your company, who has the hours to deep-dive into every investor's Twitter feed, past investments, and podcast interviews? So you reuse templates, swap out a name, and hope for the best.

**It's frustrating because you know this doesn't work.** Your message gets lost in a crowded inbox because it doesn't stand out. You feel like you're shouting into the void.

<Warning>
  If you don't fix this, you'll keep getting low reply rates, waste precious fundraising time, and miss out on connecting with the right investors who would actually love what you're building.
</Warning>

## Personalization isn't about flattery — it's about fit

The problem isn't that you don't want to personalize. It's that real personalization is incredibly time-intensive. Successful fundraisers don't just mention an investor's name — they quickly find and articulate **genuine points of connection**. They focus on relevance, not just recognition.

<Tip>
  What if you could instantly know what you have in common with an investor and weave that into your outreach — not as a trick, but as a true conversation starter?
</Tip>

## How your personalized message sequence comes together

When the AI finishes its analysis, you'll see a draft outreach sequence built around genuine connection points. Think of it as your assistant preparing your talking points before a big meeting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Social media-based personalizations">
    A relevant opening line based on their recent Twitter or LinkedIn activity — showing you pay attention, not just pitch.

    <Note>
      **Example:** "I saw your thread on the future of vertical SaaS — your point on onboarding really resonated with how we think about activation."
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deep investor research personalizations">
    Key insights drawn from their investment thesis, portfolio, or public statements — connecting your story directly to their worldview.

    | Personalization layer | Example message |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Thesis alignment** | "Given your focus on founder-led sales in early-stage B2B, I thought our go-to-market story would be relevant." |
    | **Portfolio pattern** | "Your investment in [Similar Company] highlighted the importance of [Specific Problem], which is exactly where we started." |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mutual interests and common ground">
    The AI surfaces shared connections and experiences that build instant rapport.
