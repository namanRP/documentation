## Send messages that get noticed, without the manual grind

CapitalxAI's Message Templates give you a curated library of high-converting email and LinkedIn drafts. They're built from templates that have worked for founders like you, and they're designed to be personalized in seconds with AI.

<Tip>
  Think of it as having a top-tier fundraising coach suggesting your next line—for every stage of the conversation, from the first cold email to the follow-up after a meeting.
</Tip>

These aren't just static documents. They integrate directly with your investor intelligence. Use dynamic placeholders to auto-fill names, firm details, or specific references (like a recent tweet) to make each message feel one-of-one—even though you sent it at scale.

## How to use Message Templates

Think of this as your command center for all outbound communication. Here's how it works.

### Generate with AI

Click **Generate with AI** and tell the system what you need—like "a warm follow-up email after a conference." It will draft a professional template for you, inspired by high-response messages from our community. You can then edit it to fit your voice.

### Create a new template

Press the **Create Template** button to build your own from scratch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your channel">
    Select **Email**, **LinkedIn**, **Direct Message**, or **Instagram**. This helps you organize and send the right message on the right platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a title">
    Name it for easy finding later, like "Series A First Touch – Climate Tech."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Craft your template">
    Write your message body. This is where the magic happens—use placeholders to auto-fill personal details that make every message feel handwritten.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save or discard">
    Click **Create** when you're done, or **Cancel** to discard. Build your library once, and deploy flawless, personalized outreach every time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Crafting your template with placeholders

Use dynamic placeholders to auto-fill personal details. When you send the message, these placeholders are replaced with real data from the investor's profile.

### Example template

```text Subject: Connecting on ${twitter_line}
Hi ${cleaned_name},

${twitter_line} I just read your tweet about sustainable aviation fuel
and it resonated strongly with our work at [Your Company].

${line1} I saw Accel's recent investment in GreenFlyte, which is
why I'm reaching out.

${line2} I believe your experience in climate tech could greatly
benefit us as we pioneer a new approach to fuel certification.

${additional_line} I particularly admired your post last month about
scalable verification—it's exactly the challenge we're solving.

Would you be open to a brief chat next week? I'm free on
${followUpRelativeDay} or ${followUpDateOnly}.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### How placeholders work

Simply insert these curly-bracket variables into your template. When you go to send, CapitalxAI populates them seamlessly, making each message feel personally crafted.

| Placeholder | What it does | Example output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `${cleaned_name}` | Inserts the firm name or the individual's first name, based on best practices. | "Accel" or "John" |
| `${twitter_line}` | Pulls in a relevant tweet or topic from the investor's profile to create an instant, genuine connection point. | "I saw your thread on vertical SaaS…" |
| `${line1}` | A research-backed opening line referencing a recent investment or thesis point. | "I saw Accel's recent investment in GreenFlyte…" |
| `${line2}` | A personalized line connecting your company to the investor's focus area. | "Your experience in climate tech…" |
| `${additional_line}` | An extra personalization layer drawn from the investor's public activity. | "I admired your post on scalable verification…" |
| `${followUpRelativeDay}` | Auto-calculates a suggested meeting day, intelligently skipping weekends and holidays. | "this Tuesday" |
| `${followUpDateOnly}` | Auto-calculates and inserts a specific date for the follow-up. | "February 12" |

<Note>
  Date placeholders are calculated at send time, so your suggested meeting dates are always current and relevant—no manual calendar checking required.
