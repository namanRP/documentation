## The shortcut other founders use

The most successful fundraisers don't just ask for intros—they build a **strategic path**. They realize that not all portfolio founders are equal. A recent founder has a hotter connection than one from a decade ago. An introduction from a founder who had a big exit carries more weight. The key isn't more outreach; it's **smarter, more targeted outreach** based on who you already know and who is most likely to advocate for you.

<Tip>
  Think of portfolio founders as a layered network. The closer and more recent the relationship, the warmer the intro. Your job is to find the highest-signal connections, not the most connections.
</Tip>

## Your targeted outreach engine

CapitalxAI turns that scattered search into a streamlined workflow. Our platform automatically maps every investor's portfolio and shows you a curated list of key founders from their most notable companies. Instead of guessing where to start, you get an immediate, prioritized shortlist of relevant contacts to research and approach.

## How you unlock warm intros

Here's how you use it to build your perfect pathway:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover the right founders to target">
    Navigate to an investor's profile and open the **Notable Investments** and **Founder-Investor Intro Paths** sections. Here, you'll see a curated list of their portfolio companies and key founders.

    Click the **"Search Portfolio Founders"** button. CapitalxAI generates a targeted list of founders from companies that are recent, successful, or relevant to your stage and sector. You immediately have a qualified starting point.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Research and personalize with intelligence">
    This is where you turn a list into a strategy. For each founder on the list, use the provided context—like their company's sector, the stage they raised at, and how long ago the investment was—to guide your research.

    Open their LinkedIn profile. Look for common ground:

    - Did you attend the same university?
    - Work in a similar industry?
    - Live in the same city?

    <Warning>
      This isn't about blasting templates. It's about finding a genuine point of connection for a personalized approach.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect with a compelling reason">
    With your research done, craft a message that leads with your shared common ground or a specific, credible reason for reaching out. The goal is to **start a conversation**, not ask for an intro in your first message. A genuine exchange often leads to a stronger, more credible introduction to the investor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to approach portfolio founders: a tactical guide

Once you've identified the right founders using CapitalxAI, your approach is everything. The goal is to be **compelling, not transactional**. Remember the industry standard: a **double opt-in introduction**, where both the connector and the investor agree before an intro is made. As <a href="https://avc.com/2009/11/the-double-optin-introduction/" target="_blank">Fred Wilson</a>, <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2020/07/how-to-write-an-email-intro-request/" target="_blank">Brad Feld</a>, and <a href="https://www.alexiskold.net/2015/01/03/how-to-ask-me-and-others-for-an-intro/" target="_blank">Alex Iskold</a> have all written, this respectful process is now the norm. Your job is to make it easy and low-risk for a founder to say "yes" to helping you.

    ### Lead with your shared bond

    During your research, you might discover you both went to Stanford, worked at Google, or are part of the same professional community. In this case, you can often be more direct, leading with that connection.

    <Note title="Example Request — Alumni Connection">
      **Subject:** Fellow [University] alum — quick question

      Hi [Founder Name],

      I noticed we're both [University] alums while researching [Investor Name] for our upcoming fundraise. I've admired what you've built with [Their Company].

      We're building [Your Company] in the [your sector] space and are beginning our Seed round. Given your positive experience, I was hoping I could ask for 15 minutes to hear your perspective on [Investor Name] and what they value in a partnership.

      Would you be open to a brief call next week?

      Best,<br/>
      [Your Name]
    </Note>

    <Tip>
      A shared personal connection immediately raises your response rate. Be genuine and specific—mention the exact thing you have in common.
    </Tip>

    ### The core skill: earn a conversation

    More often, you won't have a direct link. Your mission is to build enough relevance to earn a short conversation—**not** ask for an intro in the first message.

    #### Step 1: Qualify your reason

    Before you write, read about their company to choose who to contact and frame your reason. Prioritize:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Recent Founders" icon="clock">
        They raised in the last **18–24 months**. Their relationship with the investor is active and fresh. This recency makes them your strongest candidates for a relevant intro.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Sector Relevance" icon="layers">
        Their company operates in a space **adjacent or similar** to yours. A shared market context means they can credibly vouch for the opportunity you're building.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Stage Relevance" icon="milestone">
        They raised from the investor at a **similar stage** (e.g., Seed). They understand the specific dynamics and expectations the investor has at your fundraising stage.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    #### Step 2: Craft a concise, respectful cold message

    Your first message should request a brief call to learn from their specific experience. This frames you as a **peer seeking advice**, which is far more effective than a transactional ask.

    <Note title="Example Request — Sector Common Ground (FinTech)">
      **Subject:** Question from a fellow fintech founder

      Hi [Founder Name],

      I was researching [Investor Name]'s portfolio and came across [Their Company Name]. What you've built in the [specific niche, e.g., "embedded payments"] space is impressive.

      We're building [Your Company], a [your solution] for [your market]. As we prepare our Seed round, [Investor Name] is a top target given their deep focus on fintech.

      I would genuinely value 15 minutes to hear about your experience working with them—what made the partnership effective from a founder's perspective.

      Would you be open to a quick call?

      Thanks for your time,<br/>
      [Your Name]
    </Note>

    <Note title="Example Request — Stage & Process Common Ground">
      **Subject:** Learning from your Seed round experience

      Hi [Founder Name],

      Congrats on your Seed round with [Investor Name].

      We're also at the Seed stage, building [Your Company] in [your sector]. Before we reach out, I'm keen to learn from founders who've recently navigated a raise with them.

      Might you have 15 minutes to share one or two key insights on what they care about most during initial meetings?

      I appreciate any guidance,<br/>
      [Your Name]

## Why this works

This approach respects the **double opt-in process**. It allows the founder to vet you and your company in a low-pressure setting. If the call goes well and they believe you're a strong fit, they will often **offer to make an introduction**. You've turned a cold contact into a genuine advocate by building a relationship first.

  <Card title="Respectful, not pushy" icon="handshake">
    You're asking for advice, not a favor. This frames the interaction as peer-to-peer, lowering the barrier to a "yes."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Builds genuine trust" icon="heart">
    A real conversation lets the founder evaluate you firsthand. A resulting intro carries far more weight than a forwarded email.

  <Card title="Follows industry norms" icon="shield-check">
