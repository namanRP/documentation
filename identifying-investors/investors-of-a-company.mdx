## You're building lists in the dark

You know there are investors out there who should "get" your business—but finding them feels impossible. You end up Googling, scrolling through CrunchBase, and patching together information from different sources. It's messy, time-consuming, and half the data is outdated.

You waste hours building a list, only to later discover a key investor was left off, or that the lead partner has moved to a different firm. This manual grind steals time from what actually matters: **pitching and building relationships.**

## The best signal is a past check

The single strongest predictor of an investor's interest isn't what's written in their thesis blog post—it's what's written on their actual checkbook.

Investors are creatures of pattern. If they've invested in a company with a similar model, customer profile, or technical approach to yours, they already have the context, conviction, and internal case studies to understand your vision. Your job isn't to convince a blank slate; it's to find the investors whose slate already has a similar sketch on it.

<Tip>
  Think of it this way: you're not selling a new idea—you're joining a pattern an investor has already bet on.
</Tip>

## Instant, pattern-based discovery

CapitalxAI's **Find Investors of a Company** tool cuts through the noise. Instead of manual database queries, you use simple language. Describe one company that acts as your proxy, and our AI agent surfaces every investor associated with it using real-time public data.

In one click, you move from a vague hunch to a validated, actionable list of investors who have already voted with their capital in your direction.

## How it works: your 3-step workflow to find investors of any company

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click to begin">
    Inside the CapitalxAI platform, go to your **Investors** dashboard. Click the prominent **Find Investors of a Company** button. A focused search window opens, cleared for action.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe your proxy company">
    Think of a company that is a close parallel to yours. Type its name or a clear description into the search bar.

    Here are some examples to guide your thinking:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="New CRM" icon="address-book">
        Try **"HubSpot"** or **"Salesforce"**
      </Card>
      <Card title="Vertical AI tool" icon="brain">
        Try **"Harvey AI for lawyers"** or **"Procore"**
      </Card>
      <Card title="DTC brand" icon="shopping-bag">
        Try **"Glossier beauty brand"** or **"Allbirds shoes"**
      </Card>
      <Card title="Dev infrastructure" icon="server">
        Try **"Vercel hosting"** or **"Snowflake data cloud"**
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your real-time investor map ">
    Our system instantly pulls from live sources—SEC filings, news releases, and funding databases—to compile a complete list of every venture firm, angel investor, and syndicate that has invested in that company.

    You'll see them ranked, with details on:

    - **Role** — Lead vs. Participant
    - **Investment stage** — Seed, Series A, Growth, etc.
    - **Direct link** — A full profile for every investor
  </Step>
</Steps>
