## You're wasting time on the wrong people

Finding investors is hard, but finding the right person at a firm is even harder. You finally identify a great-fit fund, only to spend hours scouring LinkedIn and cobbling together email guesses. You're left with unverified contacts, outdated info, and the sinking feeling you're pitching the wrong partner. It's frustrating and inefficient.

Even worse, sending your pitch to the wrong associate or a generic info@ email can kill your momentum before you even start. If this isn't fixed, you burn precious weeks of your fundraise on manual research and dead-end outreach instead of building real relationships.

## Fundraising is about people, not just firms

A firm might be a perfect fit on paper, but you need the right champion inside. Investors specialize. One partner focuses on deep tech, another on SaaS. Emailing the general inbox or a partner in the wrong sector means your story lands with a thud.

Success doesn't come from just finding a firm's name — it comes from connecting with the individual who has the mandate, the context, and the passion for what you're building.

## Precision targeting for people and firms

CapitalxAI solves both layers of the puzzle. We help you identify the strongest-fit firms **and** connect you directly to the right decision-makers. We provide verified email addresses and LinkedIn profiles, so you stop guessing and start engaging with confidence.

No more managing a dozen spreadsheets or wondering if your research is current.

## How to find your strongest prospects

### Follow the pattern

The fastest path to an investor who "gets it" is to find those who already have. Look for investors in companies that share your core business model or customer dynamics, not just your exact industry.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

| If you are building... | Look for investors in... | Why it works | Real world example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vertical SaaS for Architects | Vertical SaaS for contractors, restaurants, or law firms. | These investors understand niche workflows, sales cycles, and the value of industry-specific software. | An investor who backed Toast (restaurants) would deeply understand Procore (construction). |
| A DTC Brand in a new category | Other DTC brands in apparel, home goods, or skincare. | They grasp direct customer acquisition, unit economics, and building a community-led business. | A partner who invested in Glossier would have context for a new brand in wellness supplements. |
| A DevTool for cloud infrastructure | Other infrastructure, data, or API-first companies. | They appreciate technical complexity, developer adoption, and platform scalability. | A firm that invested in MongoDB or Twilio would get the motion for a new database tool. |
| An AI application for healthcare | Other applied AI in regulated industries like fintech or legaltech. | They have experience with compliance, data privacy, and commercializing AI solutions. | An investor in Upstart (AI lending) would understand the risk models for an AI diagnostics tool. |

### Define your non-negotiables

Before building your list, lock in your criteria. This turns a sea of names into a targeted shortlist. Use filters like:

- **Stage:** Pre-seed, Seed, Series A
- **Check Size:** \$500K, \$1M, \$5M+
- **Role:** Must be a Partner or Lead Investor
- **Sector Focus:** Must list "AI" or "Healthcare" in thesis
- **Geography:** Invests in your region or is remote-friendly
- **Lead Interest:** Historically leads rounds (critical for larger raises)

### Connect with the right person

Finding the firm is step one. CapitalxAI takes you to step two: identifying the specific partner or principal who owns your space. We show you their verified contact details and LinkedIn, so your outreach is personal, direct, and lands in the right inbox.

For example, let's say our system identifies **Bessemer Venture Partners** as a strong fit for your enterprise SaaS company. Instead of you guessing, we show you that **Mary D'Onofrio** focuses on growth-stage SaaS and B2B software, and we provide her verified contact information. For a climate tech startup, we'd point you to **Andrew K. Sohn** at **Lowercarbon Capital**, the partner specifically driving investments in carbon removal technologies.

### Spot the active players and new entrants

Leverage insights to see who's actively writing checks in your sector and who's just starting to explore it. Active investors are in buy mode. New entrants are often hungrier and can make faster decisions.
