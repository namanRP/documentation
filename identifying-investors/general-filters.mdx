## The right investor is out there — the problem is finding them

Sifting through thousands of investor profiles is a massive time sink. You're guessing who might be a fit based on a quick glance at a website or a Crunchbase page, which is like finding a needle in a haystack.

**Why it's frustrating:** This scattershot approach leads to low reply rates and wasted effort. You end up pitching investors who don't do your stage, don't understand your sector, or simply aren't writing checks right now. It feels inefficient and can dent your confidence during an already stressful process.

**What happens if it's not fixed:** You burn precious months of your runway chasing dead ends. The longer your search drags on, the more momentum you lose, and the harder it becomes to secure the funding you need to grow.

## Precision beats volume

Successful fundraisers don't just cast a wide net. They know that investor relevance isn't a guessing game — it's a data-driven matching problem. The difference isn't working harder; it's working smarter by targeting only those investors whose historical behavior, stage focus, and sector expertise align perfectly with what you offer today.

The key is to stop searching manually and start filtering intelligently, using clear signals of intent and fit.

## Filter with purpose, not guesswork

## Your 11-point filtering toolkit

Navigate to the **Investor Search** page. On the left, you'll find the **Filters** panel. Here is your complete toolkit to build a powerful, targeted list.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Investor Type" icon="landmark">
    **Why it matters:** Not all money is the same. A pre-seed startup needs a different partner than a Series A company. This helps you focus on the right type of financial partner.

    **How to use it:** Select from Venture Capital Firms, Angel Investors, Corporate VCs, and more.

    <Tip>
      We recommend starting with **VC Firms** for institutional rounds, as they have the structure and follow-on capital to support your long-term growth.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stages" icon="layers">
    **Why it matters:** Investors are stage specialists. Pitching a Series A deal to a firm that only does seed-stage investments is a fundamental mismatch that wastes everyone's time.

    **How to use it:** Select the specific stage your company is currently in (e.g., Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A). This ensures you are only viewing investors who are actively seeking opportunities at your exact point of growth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Industries" icon="factory">
    **Why it matters:** You need investors who already speak your language and believe in your market. Sector expertise means they can evaluate you faster and provide more valuable strategic support.

    **How to use it:** Select your specific industry and sub-vertical. This immediately filters out investors who have no history or interest in your space, leaving you with experts who understand your business model.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Investment Geographies" icon="globe">
    **Why it matters:** While many investors invest globally, most have geographic patterns or mandates. This ensures you're targeting firms that are open to investing in your company's location.

    **How to use it:** Specify the countries or regions where your company operates or is headquartered. Find investors who have a proven track record of investing in those areas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Roles (for People Search)" icon="user">
    **Why it matters:** Getting your pitch to the right person inside a firm is critical. The decision-making power and focus differ greatly between a General Partner and an Associate.

    **How to use it:** When searching for individual investor contacts, filter by roles like **General Partner**, **Partner**, or **Principal** to connect directly with key decision-makers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fund Size & Check Size" icon="banknote">
    **Why it matters:** An investor's capacity dictates their ability to fund you. A firm with a \$50M fund can't write a \$5M check, and a firm with a \$1B fund won't typically write a \$100K check.

    **How to use it:**

    | Filter | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Fund Size** | Set a minimum and maximum to find firms with an appropriate fund size for your round. |
    | **Check Size** | Define the range of investment you are seeking. This aligns your ask with the investor's typical investment amount. |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="HQ Country & State/Region" icon="map-pin">
    **Why it matters:** For logistical reasons like in-person meetings, local networks, or ecosystem focus, you may want to prioritize investors based in a specific area.

    **How to use it:** Filter by the headquarters location of the venture firm, down to the state or region level (e.g., US-CA for California, India-Tamil Nadu).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Active (Yes/No)" icon="circle-check">
    **Why it matters:** An investor's website is always "active." Their checkbook often isn't. This is the simplest way to boost your reply rates by filtering out firms in hibernation.

    **How to use it:** Set this to **Yes** to see only investors who have made at least one investment in the recent past, confirming they are currently deploying capital.

    <Tip>
      Always start your search with **Active** set to **Yes**. This single filter dramatically improves the quality of your results.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leads Round (Yes/No)" icon="flag">
    **Why it matters:** For a round to come together, you need anchors. This filter separates true lead investors with the conviction to set terms from followers who only invest alongside others.

    **How to use it:** Set this to **Yes** at the start of your fundraise to build a list of investors with a clear history of leading investment rounds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Investor Tier (A/B/C)" icon="medal">
    **Why it matters:** Not all investors offer the same level of support, reputation, and founder-friendliness. This is our proprietary grading to help you prioritize quality.

    **How to use it:** Filter by **Tier A**, **B**, or **C** to prioritize top-tier firms known for being great partners, or to discover exceptional rising-star investors in lower tiers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Fit Score (Strong / Weak Fit)" icon="sparkles">
    **Why it matters:** This is your ultimate summary signal. After applying your filters, our AI analyzes each investor against your profile to give you a clear, prioritized ranking.

    **How to use it:** Watch as investors are automatically tagged. Start your outreach with the **Strong Fit** list — these are your highest-probability, most-aligned potential partners.
  </Accordion>
