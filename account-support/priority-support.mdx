We're here for you. If you have a question, a suggestion, or just want to say hello, we love hearing from you.

## Your direct line to our founders

We built this platform because we needed it ourselves. That means we're personally invested in your success. You can reach our founding team directly at [founders@capitalxai.com](mailto:founders@capitalxai.com).

We read every email. Whether it's a technical issue, feedback on a feature, or a conversation about our white-label options, we're on the other side.

## Get help when you need it

We know that fundraising moves fast, and questions can't wait. Reaching out to this address puts you in direct contact with the people who built the product. You'll get a thoughtful, human response from someone who deeply understands your workflow.

## Partners and white-label support

For our investment banking partners and consultants using our white-label platform, this is your channel for strategic support. Have a client-specific question or an integration idea? Let's talk. We're committed to being an extension of your team.

## Help us build a better product

Your feedback doesn't just get logged; it informs our roadmap. Found a bug? Let us know. Wish something worked differently? Tell us. Found an investor we're missing? Send us their details and we'll add them for you, free of charge.

We're in this with you.
