## Introducing your fundraising HQ

Unlike a generic spreadsheet, it's designed for the unique steps of securing capital.

  The Pipeline Tracker is purpose-built for fundraising workflows. Every feature—from stages to notes to exports—is designed around how founders actually raise capital.

### Your fundraising funnel

This is your core workflow. Each column is a stage, representing a key milestone in your journey with an investor. From **Identified** all the way through **Closed/Signed**, **Closed/Lost**, or even **Disappeared**, you have a complete picture of your progress.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identified">
    Investors who match your criteria enter your pipeline here. This is the top of your funnel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contacted">
    You've reached out—track who you've messaged and when.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interested">
    Investors who have responded positively or moved into active conversations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="In Due Diligence">
    Deep-dive stage where investors are evaluating your startup in detail.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Closed / Signed / Lost">
    The outcome—whether it's a signed term sheet, a pass, or a conversation that went cold.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  A healthy pipeline has consistent movement across all stages. If too many investors are stuck in one column, it's a signal to adjust your approach for that segment.
</Tip>

### Track conversations with notes

Click **Add Note** to log call summaries, investor feedback, or personal details. This builds a rich history so you or your team can pick up any conversation, fully informed. No detail gets lost in an inbox.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What should I log in notes?" icon="pencil">
    Log anything that adds context: call summaries, follow-up action items, investor preferences, feedback on your pitch, personal details mentioned in conversation, or timeline cues. The richer the history, the more effective your next touchpoint.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can my team see the notes I add?" icon="users">
    Yes. Notes are shared across your team within the pipeline, so any team member can pick up a conversation fully informed—no separate Slack threads or email chains needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Create custom sets for any need

Beyond the pipeline, create custom sets like **"Top-Tier Leads,"** **"Warm Intros,"** or **"Climate Tech Focus."** Label and group investors to slice your data and strategize for different outreach campaigns or reporting needs.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="By Priority" icon="star" color="#ca8a04">
    Tag investors as high, medium, or low priority to focus your outreach where it counts most.
  </Card>
  <Card title="By Vertical" icon="layers" color="#254bf1">
    Group investors by sector—fintech, healthtech, climate—to tailor your messaging and strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="By Geography" icon="globe" color="#16a34a">
    Segment by region to manage timezone-specific outreach or target local capital markets.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Export your data for full control

Need to share a snapshot with your board or run deeper analysis? Export your entire pipeline—with all its notes and stages—as a clean CSV file in one click. Your data is always yours.
