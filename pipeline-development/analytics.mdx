The CapitalxAI Analytics Dashboard pulls everything together into simple, powerful visuals. It automatically maps your investor relationships, scores their potential, and shows you the live status of your entire raise. It's built to replace uncertainty with insight, so you lead every conversation from a position of strength.

## How your dashboard works

This is where you move from activity to strategy. Here's how to use your data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your Fit Assessment">
    Start by understanding who in your pipeline is a **Strong Fit**. These are your highest-probability conversations and where your energy should go first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze your Pipeline Funnel">
    Check the flow of investors through each stage. Look for bottlenecks—stages where too many investors are stuck signal a need to adjust your approach.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor your recent activity">
    Use the activity feed and breakdowns to ensure you're maintaining momentum. Consistent weekly action is what separates funded founders from stalled ones.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Master your funnel

Your **Investor Pipeline** visualization shows the health of your fundraise. It's not just a count; it's a measure of momentum. Watch investors move from Identified to Contacted to Interested. The goal is to create steady flow.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Identified" icon="binoculars" color="#254bf1">
    Investors who match your criteria and have been added to your pipeline. This is the top of your funnel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contacted" icon="mail" color="#ca8a04">
    Investors you've reached out to. Track conversion from this stage to gauge the effectiveness of your outreach.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interested" icon="handshake" color="#16a34a">
    Investors who have responded positively or moved into active conversations. These are your warmest opportunities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **If too many investors are stuck in one stage, it's a clear signal to adjust your approach for that segment.** A healthy pipeline has consistent movement across all stages, not a pileup at the top.
</Warning>

## Quality over quantity

The **Fit Assessment** chart is your qualifier. Our AI analyzes each investor against your profile, delivering a clear breakdown of alignment across your entire pipeline.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Strong Fit" icon="circle-check" color="#16a34a">
    Your priority targets—these are your hottest leads with the highest probability of conversion. Focus your best outreach here.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Weak Fit" icon="circle-x" color="#dc2626">
    Helps you manage your energy. These investors are unlikely to align with your current round, so deprioritize accordingly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unclear Fit" icon="circle-minus" color="#ca8a04">
    Worth a deeper look. Limited data makes a definitive call difficult, but there may be hidden potential worth exploring.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  This tool ensures you're having the **right conversations**, not just the most conversations. A focused pipeline of 50 Strong Fit investors outperforms a scattered list of 500 unqualified names.

## Stay on top of your action

The **Recent Activity** feed and breakdowns by **Geography**, **Stage**, and **Industry** are your insight engines. They answer the key questions that keep your raise on track.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are you adding new leads weekly?" icon="calendar-plus">
    A healthy fundraise requires a consistent pipeline of fresh prospects. Your activity feed shows whether your top-of-funnel is active or stalling. Aim to add new qualified investors every week to maintain momentum.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is your focus aligned with the right sectors?" icon="crosshair">
    The Industry breakdown reveals where your effort is concentrated. If your startup is in fintech but most of your pipeline is generalist, it's time to recalibrate and target sector-specific investors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are you diversified across geographies?" icon="globe">
    The Geography view helps you spot concentration risk. Broadening your geographic reach can unlock new pools of capital and reduce dependence on a single market.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are you targeting the right investment stages?" icon="layers">
    The Stage breakdown ensures your pipeline is filled with investors who actually write checks at your stage. A seed-stage startup pitching growth-stage funds is wasting precious time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  This is how you manage your process professionally—identifying strengths and opportunities in your strategy at a glance, not buried in spreadsheets.

## Your next step

Your dashboard is live. Here's your action plan for this week.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your Fit Assessment">
    Open your dashboard and look at the Fit Assessment breakdown. Identify your **Strong Fit** investors—these are your priority outreach targets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focus your next outreach block">
    Dedicate your next outreach session exclusively to Strong Fit investors. Personalize each message using the AI's reasoning for their fit score.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your Pipeline Funnel">
    Which stage has the **least movement**? That's your tactical priority for the week. If investors are stuck at Contacted, refine your follow-up cadence. If the top of funnel is thin, go back to identification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Let the data guide your focus">
    Review your Geography, Industry, and Stage breakdowns. Adjust your targeting if you spot gaps or over-concentration. A balanced, data-driven pipeline is a funded pipeline.
  </Step>
